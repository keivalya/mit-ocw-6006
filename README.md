# 6.006 Introduction to Algorithms

### Spring 2020 / Undergraduate
I am taking [this](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/6-006-introduction-to-algorithms-spring-2020/) MIT OpenCourseWare MOOC to strengthen my Algorithms foundations.

### Prerequisites
- [6.0001 Introduction to Computer Science and Programming in Python](https://github.com/keivalya/mit-ocw-6001):  Basic experience programming in Python 3.
- [6.042J Mathematics for Computer Science: Basic knowledge of discrete mathematics](https://github.com/keivalya/): set theory, relations and logic, combinatorics, proofs, recursion, number theory, graph theory, and probability.

### Textbooks
Throughout this course I have referred to the [Introduction to Algorithms](https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262533058/introduction-to-algorithms/) Textbook by Cormen, Leiserson, Rivest, and Stein (Third Edition, MIT Press) ISBN: 9780262033848, commonly known as CLRS.
